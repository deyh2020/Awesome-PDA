# Awesome Photonic Design Automation [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Here the repo contains many useful references in the area of photonic design automation (PDA). The goal of PDA is to use algorithmic methods (such as graph theory, optimization methods, statistics, and machine learning) to ease human burden when designing a photonics chip. 

The reference list below will be updated regularly along the author's reading and research. If you find some overlooked papers, please open issues, contact the author at [zhengqi@mit.edu](mailto:zhengqi@mit.edu), or pull requests.

## Electromagnetic (EM) Basics

- [John D. Jackson, 'Classical Electrodynamics'](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Classical+Electrodynamics%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9780471309321) 
    - A classical textbook in EM. It is very comprehensive and math dense. It is more appropriate to readers who have background in EM.

- [David J. Griffiths, 'Introduction to Electrodynamics'](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/introduction-to-electrodynamics/3AB220820DBB628E5A43D52C4B011ED4#overview)
    - A classical textbook in EM. Compared to Jackson's, Griffiths's is more beginner friendly. It has many graphical illustrations and the math derivation is step by step. However, a few advanced topics are not covered (e.g., Green functions).

- [David H. Staelin, Ann Morgenthaler, and Jin Au Kong 'Electromagnetic Waves'](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Staelin-Electromagnetic-Waves/PGM63919.html)
    - A Classical textbook in EM. Jackson's and Griffiths's start from electrostatics, while this book directly starts from electrodynamics. In this sense, it is more suitable if you are looking for a book 'more cut to the point'.

- [Katsunari Okamoto, 'Fundamentals of Optical Waveguides'](https://www.elsevier.com/books/fundamentals-of-optical-waveguides/okamoto/978-0-12-525096-2)

    - The first two chapters give good explanations on modes in waveguide.
